make your own list
------------------
This is a create your own list. I made it so that it will take your input and create a list item. It uses handlebars js to handle the list item creation. By adding in more jquery I provided additional features such as: marking an item as complete by clicking it, making it so each item can be taken off the list by clicking the 'x', having a clear all button, and last but not least adding an auto sort feature.
